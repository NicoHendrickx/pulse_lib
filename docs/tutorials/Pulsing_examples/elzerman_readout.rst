Elzerman readout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let's assume for our two qubit sample, that we tuned it into the single qubit regime and have a charge stabiltity diagram that looks like:

<<< diagram >>>

To perform the readout, we will have to pulse to the following points:

<<< diagram >>>

So in practice, we need to construct the following pulses:
